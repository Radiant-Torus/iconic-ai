## 🎯 Your Two Revenue Streams

Partners pay you for AI-generated leads in their niche.

### 2. **Google Maps Audit Service** ($111, $222, $333, $555/month)

## 📋 What Only YOU Do (Admin Only)

You have special admin access to features that your partners cannot see.

### **The Audit Dashboard** (`/audit`)
This is YOUR private tool. Only you can access it.

**What you do:**
1. Partners send you their business names
2. You go to `/audit` and create an audit record
3. You verify their Google Maps data is accurate
4. You assign a "Grounding Score" (0-100%)
5. You flag any hallucinations (false information)
6. You send them the audit report

**Example:**
- Partner: "Serenity Yoga Studio"
- You search Google Maps, verify hours/location/reviews
- You give them a score: 95% (very accurate) or 65% (needs fixes)
- Partners pay you $111-$555/month for this service
